        <h2>Assignment Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <article id="question-1">
          <h3>1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h3>
          <img src="graph for blink.jpg" alt="Answer to Question 1 - Resistor purpose" />
          <p>Caption: based on the frequency of the blinking, the graph shows either high voltage or 0 voltage.</p>
        </article>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <article id="question-2">
          <h3>2. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h3>
          <img src="question2-answer.jpg" alt="Answer to Question 2 - Resistor calculation process" />
          <p>Caption: Steps taken to calculate the total current with 14 red bulbs.</p>
        </article>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <article id="question-3">
          <h3>3. 4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
          <p>When I tried turning it to high voltage for 5 ms and low voltage for 5 ms, I could not tell that the bulb was blinking .</p>
