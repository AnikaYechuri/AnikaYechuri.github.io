        <p>Caption: I ended up using a 220 ohm resistor becasue, in my calculation, the minimum resistance needed for this circuit is 160 ohms. I used 220 becasue I did not have a 160 ohm resistor and a higher resistor uses less power and is more energy efficient. </p>

      <!-- Section: Button Resistance -->
      <section id="button-resistance">
        <h2>Button Resistance Explanation</h2>
        <p>A 10kÎ© resistor is commonly used for pull-up buttons because it provides a stable and consistent signal (HIGH or LOW) while keeping power usage low. It prevents electrical noise, ensuring reliable readings, and minimizes the current when the button is pressed. This value works well for most digital circuits like Arduino inputs, balancing efficiency and signal stability.</p>

        <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <article id="question-1">
          <h3>1.  Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255).</h3>
          <img src="question1_fade.jpg" alt="Picture of different intervals using analogue write" />
          <p>AnalogueWrite(led,255) means that the light is on 100% of the time and off 0% of the time in any given interval. AnalogueWrite(led,128) means that in a given period, the light is high for 50% of the time and off for 50%. Finally AnalogueWrite(led,64) means that the led is one for 25% of the time and off for 75% of the time.</p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <article id="question-2">
          <img src="fade_q2.jpg" alt="Picture of calculations to find circuit runtime" />
          <h3>2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</h3>
          <p>I had 3 leds. the first and third LEDs were blinking and the second one was fading. The image above showed how I calculated the current for each blinking light and the fading light. I used the equation (runtime = battery capacity/total current drawn) and got a total runtime of 33.1 hours.</p>
