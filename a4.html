        <p>This demo shows the remote sending signals to the IR reciever. When the on button is pressed and held the IR reciver reacts and the servo starts to move. When the button is not rpessed the servo turns off.</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <article id="question-1">
          <h3>1. Say you are using a servo motor attached to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
            <pre><code>
              for (int i = 0; i < 180; i++) {
                myServo.write(i);
                delay(100);
              }
            </code></pre>
            Draw a graph with the X-axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the Y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.
          </h3>
          <img src="libraries_q1_graph.jpg" alt="Graph of voltage at pin 9 over time during servo sweep" />
          <p>As time passes, more voltage is required for each successive cycle so the angle keeps increasing.I tried to show that in my graph by exaggerating the width of the high voltage sections. The low voltage is a constant 100ms while the periods of high voltage get larger and larger til the angle hits 180.  </p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <article id="question-2">
          <h3>2. Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
          <img src="libraries_q2.jpg" alt="Example of input device with occasional erroneous readings" />
          <p>I would use multiple values to calculate the average so that even if the reading is off one percent of the time, it wont effecr the overall average too much.</p>
        </article>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <article id="question-3">
          <h3>3. Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
          <img src="libraries_q3.jpg" alt="Example of noisy sensor readings with random deviations" />
          <p>I answered by saying that I would keep track of the average readings and asess each new reading to see if it is close enough to the average. I would set the upper and lower threshold as about 10% above and below the calculated average.</p>
