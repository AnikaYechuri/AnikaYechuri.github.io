        <p>Caption: There are 2 schematics in the image above. The top one shows the voltage dividor with the photo resistor acting as R1 and the 10k ohm resistor acting as R2. There is a pin that reads the voltage between the 2 resistors. The second schematic shows that the motor connecting to an input pin.</p>

        <h2>Resistance Calculations</h2>
        <img src="input_output_resistance_calc.jpg" alt="Picture of resistor calculations for the circuit" />
        <p>Caption: At the voltage divider, we can read any voltage between 0-5 V since 5 is the max voltage we have for the arduino. The actual voltage is dependent on the the ratio between the 2 resistors. In my sample calculation I showed the voltage at the pin when the fixed resistor was 10k ohms and the photoresistor was 15 ohm resistor. At the pin the voltage would be 4.99V since the difference between the 2 resistors is so big.</p>

        <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <article id="question-1">
          <h3>1. In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</h3>
          <p>In a voltage divider circuit, the variable resistor (the photoresistor in your case) can technically be either R1 or R2, but it’s typically chosen to be R1 because when the photoresistor is in the top part of the voltage divider (R1), the output voltage is directly proportional to the amount of light. This makes it easier to understand and control the circuit. For example, a higher light results in a higher output voltage.</p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <article id="question-2">
          <h3>2. Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</h3>
          <img src="input_output_q2.jpeg" alt="" />
          <p>Until the voltage divider, the Votage drop decreases at one rate but after the divider, the voltage drops at a way more rapid rate. The voltage divider read 2V.</p>
        </article>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <article id="question-3">
            <h3>2. AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h3>
            <p>With 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter , the map() function would need to scale values to match the new ranges. For example, to map a 10-bit ADC reading (0-1023) to a 16-bit PWM range (0-65535), the code would be: int pwmValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 65535). The change would probably increase the overall precision of the readings. This would help control things like the brightness of an led.</p>
